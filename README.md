# IgDesign
Read the [IgDesign paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.08.570889v2).


## Installation

Install the environment. We recommend [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io) as the package manager:
```sh
$ micromamba env create -f environment.yml
$ micromamba activate igdesign
```

Install the igdesign package:
```sh
$ pip install -e .
```

## Download model weights
In order to download our pretrained model weights please use the provided shell script:
```sh
$ chmod +x download_ckpts.sh
$ ./download_ckpts.sh
```
This script will download the LMDesign and fine-tuned ProteinMPNN weights associated
with the split which excluded the [ACVR2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/93) target.

## Inference
To inverse fold sequences, run `predict.py` with the environment activated to use the default config with PDB:1N8Z (Trastuzumab-HER2):

```sh
$ (igdesign) python predict.py
```

To use a different config specify the `--config_name` parameter, for example using PDB:5NGV (Bimagrumab-ACVR2B)
```sh
$ (igdesign) python predict.py --config_name 5ngv.yaml
```

The output will be a CSV containing sequences and (if specified) cross-entropy losses for all of the specified CDRs. For example, the column `"hcdr3"` corresponds to the generated HCDR3s and the column `"ce_loss_independent_hcdr3"` corresponds to the cross-entropy scores.

## Configuration
Inference details are specified using YAML configs, examples of which can be found in `./configs`. Each config uses the following parameters:
- `structure_path`: Path to a PDB file with the desired structure
- `lmdesign_checkpoint`: Path to IgDesign checkpoint
- `pmpnn_checkpoint`: Path to IgMPNN checkpoint
- `save_path`: Path to save generated sequences and scores
- `region_order`: List of CDRs to be designed and the order they will be designed in
- `lmdesign_num_decoding_orders`: Number of decoding orders used during IgDesign inference
- `lmdesign_num_pmpnn_seqs`: Number of IgMPNN sequences used during IgDesign inference
- `lmdesign_num_lm_seqs`: Number of language model samples used during IgDesign inference
- `lmdesign_pmpnn_logit_temperature`: Sampling temperature for IgMPNN
- `lmdesign_output_logit_temperature`: Sampling temperature for IgDesign
- `independent_loss`: If true, computes cross-entropy loss using IgDesign
- `condition_on_light_chain`: If true, conditions on light chain sequence
- `condition_on_antigen`: If true, conditions on antigen sequence
- `epitope_idxs_or_all`: Set to `"all"` to use full antigen. Set to a list of indices to use a subset of the antigen
- `antigen_chain_id`: Chain ID in PDB file for antigen
- `heavy_chain_id`: Chain ID in PDB file for heavy chain
- `light_chain_id`: Chain ID in PDB file for light chain
- `regions`: Each key of this should be a CDR in `region_order` mapping to `positions` (list of indices corresponding to the CDR) and `chain` (either `"heavy"` or `"light"`)

## Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Data
SPR data generated from validating IgDesign is included in `"./data"` with representative sensorgrams in `"./data/Sensorgrams"`. Each CSV corresponds to one antibody-antigen system. The columns for each dataset are:
- `Target`: The target screened against
- `Reference Ab`: The reference antibody used
- `Method`: Method for sequence generation. Either `"Positive Control"`, `"SAbDab"`, or `"Inverse Folding"`
- `HCDRs Designed`: Except for positive control, either `"HCDR3"` or `"HCDR123"`
- `HCDR1`: HCDR1 sequence
- `HCDR2`: HCDR2 sequence
- `HCDR3`: HCDR3 sequence
- `KD (nM)`: Binding affinity measured in SPR (average of replicates)
- `Binding Replicates`: Number of observed binding replicates
- `Replicates`: Number of observed replicates
- `Ratio Binding Replicates`: Ratio of replicates that show binding
- `Binder`: True for binders, False for non-binders. Except for positive controls, we call a sequence a binder if it binds in all replicates, otherwise we call it a non-binder.
- scRMSD columns: Columns for scRMSD are organized by region (one of `"HCDR1"`, `"HCDR2"`, `"HCDR3"`, `"HCDR123"`, or `"Fv"`) followed by `"scRMSD"` and followed by the model or strategy in parentheses (`"ABB2"` for ABodyBuilder2, `"ABB3"` for ABodyBuilder3, `"ABB3-LM"` for ABodyBuilder3-LM, `"ESMFold"` for ESMFold, `"Mean/Min/Max Ensemble"` for mean/min/max ensembles).

`Note`: At this time, we have released datasets for 7 out of 8 antibody-antigen systems used to evaluate IgDesign. The dataset for CD40-Ravagalimab has sequences blinded as X's and is included in `"./data/Blinded"`.
